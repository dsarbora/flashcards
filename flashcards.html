                <p class = "parameters content">Parameters are hypothetical data that your function is meant to use to get something done. The number of parameters is how many you should use when calling it, and the names of the parameters will remind you or another developer what type of data they should be.

It can be made of what look to you and me like numbers, but a computer will not treat it as such unless told to do so. Data types made of numbers may be integers or strings, so keep them straight!</p>

                <p class = "undefined content">"Undefined" is what you see when you try to ask a computer for the value of a variable, but you haven't yet told the computer what exactly the variable is. Asking a computer to divide 5 by 7 and asking it for the answer isn't going to be enough. You have to tell a computer that the answer is 5 divided by 7, and <em>then</em> you can ask what the answer is. </p>

                <p class = "escape content">Sometimes you need a good escape. I looked it up and the value of it escapes me honestly, the best I can tell is that it looks like "escape" is a function that replaces the value of certain characters with a 2 digit hex code. Seems to be a way for a computer to read umlauts and accents for letters in other languages.</p>
